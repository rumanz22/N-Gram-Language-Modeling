# N-Gram Language Modeling
using n-grams for sentiment analysis
1. Project Objective & Relevance
The goal of the project is clearly defined: to perform sentiment analysis on airline-related tweets. This is a well-established and practical NLP problem, making it highly relevant for learning real-world applications of natural language processing. It involves extracting insights from unstructured textual data, which is a critical skill in data science.

ðŸ“Š 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Strengths:

EDA includes a breakdown of sentiment classes, showing the class distribution.

Visualizations like bar plots and word clouds help highlight the most frequent terms used in each sentiment class.

Good use of Seaborn and Matplotlib to make insights more digestible.

Suggestions:

Could enhance analysis by exploring:

The time-based trend of tweets (e.g., sentiment over time).

Most common complaints or compliments per airline.

Analysis of tweet length or hashtags used.

ðŸ§¹ 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Strengths:

Well-structured text preprocessing pipeline using:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation

Stopword removal using NLTK

Lemmatization for normalization

Implementation of tokenization is appropriate and shows understanding of NLP foundations.

Suggestions:

Consider adding a custom stopword list (e.g., "flight", "airline") that might bias sentiment.

Emoticons and hashtags (e.g., #unitedfail) could be treated as sentiment indicators, not discarded.

ðŸ§  4. Feature Engineering
Strengths:

Used both Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer, allowing experimentation and comparison.

This shows a good grasp of how different text representations impact model performance.

Suggestions:

Consider applying n-grams (e.g., bigrams or trigrams) to capture more context in phrases.

Dimensionality reduction (e.g., using SVD or PCA) could be explored to improve computational efficiency.

ðŸ¤– 5. Machine Learning Models
Strengths:

Multiple models are trained and evaluated, including:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Shows an understanding of model comparison and trade-offs.

Suggestions:

Model hyperparameters could be tuned (e.g., with GridSearchCV) to potentially improve performance.

Deep learning models like LSTM or BERT could be added for modern NLP comparison (optional but valuable).

ðŸ“ˆ 6. Model Evaluation
Strengths:

Evaluations include:

Accuracy scores

Confusion matrices

Classification reports with precision, recall, and F1-scores

This shows a thorough approach to understanding model performance.

Suggestions:

Since the dataset is imbalanced (more negative tweets), consider using techniques like:

Stratified sampling

Class weighting

SMOTE for oversampling the minority classes

ðŸ“š 7. Coding Style & Structure
Strengths:

Clear and logical notebook structure: data loading â†’ cleaning â†’ EDA â†’ modeling â†’ evaluation.

Functions and modular blocks are well-organized and commented.

Suggestions:

Add markdown summary cells after major steps to recap key findings.

Include a final "Conclusion" section summarizing what was learned and future work suggestions.

ðŸ’¡ Overall Impression
This is a solid NLP project that demonstrates a strong foundation in:

Text data processing

Feature extraction

Machine learning classification

Model evaluation and comparison

It reflects thoughtful experimentation and solid analytical skills. With minor enhancementsâ€”such as hyperparameter tuning, handling class imbalance more explicitly, and testing n-grams or deep learning methodsâ€”it would be an excellent portfolio piece.
